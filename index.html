				<h2>MANGA</h2>
				<p>
					Berserk (ベルセルク Beruseruku?) is a long-running dark
					fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro
					Miura. Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The
					first volume of the manga was published on November 26, 1990
					by Hakusensha in its Jets Comics collection. After three
					more volumes were published, Berserk was serialized in Young
					Animal in 1992 and is still being released.
				</p>
				<p>
					The series was adapted into a twenty-five episode anime
					series, Kenpū Denki Berserk (ベルセルク剣風伝奇 Beruseruku
					Kenpū Denki?), by Oriental Light and Magic. It debuted in
					Japan on October 7, 1997, on Nippon Television; the final
					episode aired on March 31, 1998. It covered the first arc:
					Golden Age. Two video games were also created for the
					series: an action adventure for the Dreamcast and another
					for the PlayStation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Berserk's setting is inspired by medieval Europe. It centers
					around the life of Guts, an orphaned mercenary warrior, and
					Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the Band of
					the Hawk (鷹の団 Taka no Dan?). As he ages, Guts changes
					from a solitary boy into a man who realizes the value of
					camaraderie. The story contains elements of both fantasy and
					horror, as it explores both the best and worst of human
					nature. Both the manga and anime are noted for their heavy
					violence.

								With director Naohito Takahashi at the helm, the
								first animated version of this Seinen series was
								produced by Oriental Light and Magic. This
								adaptation follows the manga's Black Swordsman
								and Golden Age arcs, showcasing Guts' burgeoning
								relationship with the Band of the Hawk. Several
								manga characters were entirely excised, like
								Puck and Donovan.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, cutting out the Skull Knight resulted
								in an infamous plot hole as it fails to explain
								how Guts and Casca escape Femto after the
								Eclipse. The overt violence and mature tone of
								the original manga was drastically toned down
								for the anime, although the show inevitably ends
								on a mournful note. Further, removing some of
								the manga's gags helped make the anime narrative
								more solemn.

							<h3>The Egg of the King</h3>
							<p>
								A soldier named Guts attracts the attention of a
								mercenary group, The Band of the Hawk, when he
								kills an enemy champion during a siege. He is
								forced into joining the group after being
								defeated in single combat by its leader,
								Griffith. The Band of the Hawk are employed by
								the Kingdom of Midland for its Hundred Year War
								against the Tudor Empire, and Griffith rises in
								the kingdom's hierarchy after a successful
								battle. During another siege, Guts and Griffith
								encounter the demon Nosferatu Zodd, who notices
								the pendant around Griffith's neck and warns
								Guts that Griffith will be his doom. Griffith's
								rise in status is ill-received by Midland's
								noblemen, and there is a failed assassination
								attempt on Griffith by the king's brother,
								Julius. Griffith charges Guts with murdering
								Julius, and Guts also kills the noble's young
								son. Guts, emotionally scarred by his actions,
								overhears Griffith say that The Band of the Hawk
								are his comrades, but for people to be friends
								they must purse their own dreams and not someone
								else's.
							</p>
							<h3>The Battle for Doldrey</h3>
							<p>
								Guts and Casca are separated from The Band of
								the Hawk, and fend off attacks by the Tudor's
								cruel commander Adon and his men. Guts defeats
								most of Adon's men while covering Casca's
								escape, but begins to lament his life's path and
								decides he will eventually leave the Band of the
								Hawk, find and pursue his own dream, and become
								a true friend to Griffith. Later, the Band of
								the Hawk participates in the battle to capture
								the impenetrable Fortress of Doldrey and end the
								Hundred Years War, wherein Casca kills Adon. A
								month after the war's end, Guts parts ways with
								Griffith after defeating him in a duel. Griffith
								is distraught at Guts' departure, and in a lapse
								of judgment he is caught sleeping with the
								king's daughter, Charlotte. Griffith is charged
								with treason and imprisoned in the Tower of
								Rebirth while the members of the Band of the
								Hawk are branded outlaws.
							</p>
							<h3>The Advent</h3>
							<p>
								A year after Guts' departure from the Band of
								the Hawk, he returns to aid them in freeing
								Griffith from the Tower of Rebirth. However,
								when they find Griffith he is barely alive,
								rendered mute, and physically withered after
								months of torture. Griffith attempts suicide,
								and his pendant reacts to his despair, opening a
								portal to another dimension experiencing a solar
								eclipse that draws in him and The Band of the
								Hawk. There, they encounter archdemons known as
								The God Hand and Griffith is told that his
								tribulations have been leading to this moment,
								when Griffith agrees to sacrifice his allies in
								exchange for being reborn as Femto, a member of
								the God Hand. The Band of the Hawk are
								slaughtered by the God Hand's monstrous Apostles
								(former humans like Nosferatu Zodd) and Femto
								rapes Casca. Guts loses his left arm and right
								eye trying to save Casca, but Casca loses her
								sanity from the nightmarish ordeal. Guts and
								Casca are spirited back to their world by the
								mysterious Skull Knight, who tells Guts he has
								been branded by the God Hand and will be
								subjected to nightly attacks by evil creatures.
								Guts leaves Casca under the care of former
								comrade Rickert and embarks on a journey to hunt
								down Apostles and the God Hand.

								Compared to The Golden Age Arc films, the
								Memorial Edition isn't radically different in
								terms of story and plot. However, this
								remastered adaptation directed by Yuta Sano has
								been repackaged in the form of a TV show, with
								minor tonal and visual modifications. The first
								episode of the Memorial Edition, titled "The
								Golden Age," was released on October 2nd, 2022.
							</p>
							<p>
								The entire show will run for 12 episodes and
								includes the legendary "Bonfire of Dreams"
								sequence from the manga and the 1997 series.
								This is a crucial moment for both the narrative
								and the fandom, as it contextualizes Guts'
								changing relationship with the Band of the Hawk.
								Although the Berserk fandom was unquestionably
								delighted with this recent adaptation, most
								would rather have the Fantasia arc animated.
